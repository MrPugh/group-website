        <title>Report from Microservices: Agile and DevOps Experiences (MADE18)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/made18.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 21st, 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#sg&quot;&gt;Saverio Giallorenzo&lt;/a&gt; co-chaired the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/made18/&quot;&gt;Second International Workshop on Microservices: Agile and DevOps Experience (MADE18)&lt;/a&gt;, co-located with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agilealliance.org/xp2018/&quot;&gt;XP2018&lt;/a&gt; conference in Porto, Portugal.
The workshop has been a success, with 30+ attendees and highly participated presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop opened with an account on “Technical Debt in Continuous Architecting Processes” given by the workshop’s keynote speaker Antonio Martini, followed by a call for collaboration in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://microservices.sdu.dk/&quot;&gt;Microservices Community&lt;/a&gt;, given by Giallorenzo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepted authors presented 7 works in total, comprising studies on the impact of microservice development in teams and companies, DevOps techniques for the development of microservices, and tools to aid the design, development, and transition to microservice architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giallorenzo also presented a coding, hands-on session called “Microservices, all the way down”, where he illustrated how, using the Jolie language, suitable language abstractions can loose the implicit coupling that often binds collaborating microservices: communication. Interested readers can find the full abstract below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;microservices-all-the-way-down--hands-on-experience&quot;&gt;Microservices, all the way down | Hands-on Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main tenets of the microservice approach is to loose the ties among (distributed) software components (i.e., microservices), so that they can be developed, evolved, and scaled independently. However, there is one often-overlooked element that binds indirectly together collaborating microservices: communication. This binding consists of the dependencies on the libraries and/or frameworks that support the communication protocols and data formats that are chosen in the design of the microservice architecture. Regardless of whether this choice was conscious or not, it can quickly lead to technical debt unless it is carefully managed: the programming paradigms of each library tend to leak into the core logic of the microservice, making switching to other communication stacks difficult or even infeasible. All of a sudden, the so-advertised resilience of microservices gave way to an inflexible and limiting architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this hands-on demonstration we will see, using the Jolie language, how suitable language abstractions can loose these implicit couplings. The ultimate aim is to experiment how, through the lens of Jolie, web services, traditional programs, and even IoT devices are all the same: microservices, all the way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#sg&quot;&gt;Saverio Giallorenzo&lt;/a&gt; is co-chairing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/made18/&quot;&gt;Second International Workshop on Microservices: Agile and DevOps Experience (MADE18)&lt;/a&gt; taking place on May 21st, 2018 and co-located with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agilealliance.org/xp2018/&quot;&gt;XP2018&lt;/a&gt; conference in Porto, Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MADE18 is the follow-up workshop of the first International Workshop on Microservices for Agile software development (WMSA17) organized at XP2017. The venue is also a continuation of discussions on software engineering from the first International Conference on Microservices (&lt;a href=&quot;/events/2017-10-25-Microservices_Conference&quot;&gt;Microservices
2017&lt;/a&gt; organized by the members of CL. The workshop will be conducted in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://microservices.sdu.dk/&quot;&gt;Microservices Community&lt;/a&gt;, which was formed at the Microservices 2017 conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting the website call for papers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the last years, cloud-native architectures have emerged as a target platform for the deployment of microservice architectures. The migration of existing monoliths into cloud-native applications is still in the early phase, and only few companies already started their migrations. Therefore, success and failure stories about different approaches are not available in the literature. This context connects also to the recently discussed DevOps context where development and continuous deployment are closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To address the current uncertainties including a limited documentation of best-practice and benefits, this workshop aims at collecting experiences on microservice adoption, reporting best practices, but also specially failure cases, so as to build a community knowledge based on previous errors and successes. The workshop is open to experience reports from practitioners and academia.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creation of the Microservices Community</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/microservices-community.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the discussion panels at &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2017-10-25-Microservices_Conference&quot;&gt;Microservices 2017&lt;/a&gt;, participants recognised the importance of constituting a communal place where international people from research institutions, private companies, universities, and public organisations (like municipalities) can share knowledge and foster collaborations about microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prompted by this observation, the organisers of &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2017-10-25-Microservices_Conference&quot;&gt;Microservices 2017&lt;/a&gt; in CL put forward the initiative of &lt;a href=&quot;http://microservices.sdu.dk/&quot;&gt;Microservices Community&lt;/a&gt;, with the support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sdu.dk/en&quot;&gt;SDU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main activities of the initiative comprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the organise the International Conference on Microservices once a year (http://conf-micro.services), which acts also as a recurring opportunity for the physical gathering of the community;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;supporting the organisation of focused events on microservices. Examples include: technical workshops on industrial technologies, national meetings (like the Italian Meeting on Microservices), and academic forums;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;providing funding opportunities for travelling and the organisation of events in general;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;publishing open access material on microservices, either through the website as informal publications (white papers), or through more formal channels (like edited books with chapters from multiple authors, or journals);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;provide resources for the digital platform of the community, including this website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several institutions and companies &lt;a href=&quot;http://microservices.sdu.dk/#members&quot;&gt;quickly joined&lt;/a&gt; the young yet growing community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First International Conference on Microservices</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/microservices-2017-group.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CL organised the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://conf-micro.services/&quot;&gt;International Conference on Microservices&lt;/a&gt; with the aim to provide a forum for the discussion of all aspects of designing and programming microservice architectures. Both theoretical and experimental contributions are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to industrial experience reports and demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In microservices, software components are services that can be independently deployed and scaled. This brings all the benefits, but also all the issues, of distributed computing to the internals of applications. The resulting increase in complexity calls for a proportional improvement of techniques for software construction. This requires contributions from different areas, ranging from formal methods to software engineering and the general art of programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will place particular emphasis on the identification of the challenges that the community of microservices will face in the future, promising directions, and open discussions (panels) with experts from academia and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design and implementation of microservice architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Empirical studies of microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software engineering methods for microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security in microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Formal models for microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Verification (both static and runtime) of microservice systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Programming languages and techniques for microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing for microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>First Edition of the Meeting on Microservices</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid mx-auto d-block&quot; src=&quot;/images/posts/meeting-on-microservices.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edition 2016 of the Meeting on Microservices (MoM2016) took place on December 20th, 2016. The event has been mainly organised by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.italianasoftware.com/&quot;&gt;ItalianaSoftware&lt;/a&gt;, a close industrial collaborator of CL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoM2016 has been the first Italian venue dedicated to IT technologies based on microservices, ranging from practical experiences and applications, to more technical and theoretical aspects. The event has been hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monrifgroup.net/en/&quot;&gt;Monrif S.p.A.&lt;/a&gt;, the fifth publishing group in Italy and early adopter of microservice technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event, small, medium, and large companies reported their experiences
with the adoption and usage of microservices in production. The event also
included discussion panels on Industry 4.0 and digitalisation as well as
academic presentations. Among these, &lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#sg&quot;&gt;Saverio
Giallorenzo&lt;/a&gt; gave a talk on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saveriogiallorenzo.com/publications/seminars/MoM2016.pdf&quot;&gt;interplay
between microservices and choreographies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
