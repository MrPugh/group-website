We also use logic and state-of-the-art solvers to optimize real world problems such as scheduling, packing, timetabling, configuration, and logistics problems.",

In this paradigm, communications are specified using an Alice-to-Bob notation, rather than as two separate send and receive actions. As a consequence, protocols are guaranteed not to deadlock because of communication mismatches. Models based on choreographic programming have been successfully developed for different settings where concurrent programming is challenging, including service-oriented computing and cyber-physical systems.<br />In our group, we are extending choreographic programming by developing more expressive and powerful languages that can be used in real-world applications. The main challenge is to increase expressitivy while maintaining the good theoretical properties that made choreography languages successful in the first place.",

One of the challenges involved in managing this data is ensuring its internal consistency, especially as the information being stored changes due to the evolution of the real-world data it models.<br />Modern-day database management systems address this problem by allowing the user to define integrity constraints &ndash; properties of the data that should hold at all times &ndash; and algorithms to repair the database when these properties no longer hold. Extending these techniques to more powerful reasoning tools, such as those used in the Semantic Web, is however an ongoing complex process, which we address in our research.",
