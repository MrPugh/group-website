    "abstract": "Microservices is an architectural style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Before presenting the current state of the art in the field, this chapter reviews the history of software architecture, the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and services first, and microservices later. Finally, open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey primarily addresses newcomers to the discipline, while offering an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition, we investigate some practical issues and point out a few potential solutions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, unifying theories for processes combining non-determinism with quantitative aspects (such as probabilistic or stochastically timed executions) have been proposed with the aim of providing general results and tools. This paper provides two contributions in this respect. First, we present a general GSOS specification format and a corresponding notion of bisimulation for non-deterministic processes with quantitative aspects. These specifications define labelled transition systems according to the ULTraS model, an extension of the usual LTSs where the transition relation associates any source state and transition label with state reachability weight functions (like, e.g., probability distributions). This format, hence called Weight Function GSOS (WF-GSOS), covers many known systems and their bisimulations (e.g. PEPA, TIPP, PCSP) and GSOS formats (e.g. GSOS, Weighted GSOS, Segala-GSOS). <br/> The second contribution is a characterization of these systems as coalgebras of a class of functors, parametric in the weight structure. This result allows us to prove soundness and completeness of the WF-GSOS specification format, and that bisimilarities induced by these specifications are always congruences.",

    "abstract": "Weighted labelled transition systems are LTSs whose transitions are given weights drawn from a commutative monoid, subsuming a wide range of systems with quantitative aspects. In this paper we extend this theory towards other behavioural equivalences, by considering semirings of weights. Taking advantage of this extra structure, we consider a general notion of weak weighted bisimulation, which coincides with the usual weak bisimulations in the cases of non-deterministic and fully-probabilistic systems. We present a general algorithm for deciding weak weighted bisimulation. The procedure relies on certain systems of linear equations over the semiring of weights hence it can be readily instantiated to a wide range of models. We prove that these systems admit a unique solution for Ï‰-continuous semirings",
