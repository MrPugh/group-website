    "abstract": "Microservices is an architectural style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Before presenting the current state of the art in the field, this chapter reviews the history of software architecture, the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and services first, and microservices later. Finally, open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey primarily addresses newcomers to the discipline, while offering an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition, we investigate some practical issues and point out a few potential solutions.",

    "abstract": "We introduce loose graph simulations (LGS), a new notion about labelled graphs which subsumes in an intuitive and natural way subgraph isomorphism (SGI), regular language pattern matching (RLPM) and graph simulation (GS). Being a unification of all these notions, LGS allows us to express directly also problems which are \"mixed\" instances of previous ones, and hence which would not fit easily in any of them. After the definition and some examples, we show that the problem of finding loose graph simulations is NP-complete, we provide formal translation of SGI, RLPM, and GS into LGSs, and we give the representation of a problem which extends both SGI and RLPM. Finally, we identify a subclass of the LGS problem that is polynomial.",

    "abstract": "Weighted labelled transition systems are LTSs whose transitions are given weights drawn from a commutative monoid, subsuming a wide range of systems with quantitative aspects. In this paper we extend this theory towards other behavioural equivalences, by considering semirings of weights. Taking advantage of this extra structure, we consider a general notion of weak weighted bisimulation, which coincides with the usual weak bisimulations in the cases of non-deterministic and fully-probabilistic systems. We present a general algorithm for deciding weak weighted bisimulation. The procedure relies on certain systems of linear equations over the semiring of weights hence it can be readily instantiated to a wide range of models. We prove that these systems admit a unique solution for Ï‰-continuous semirings",
