As a research group, we are actively involved in teaching within the Computer Science degrees at the University of Southern Denmark.
At the undergraduate level, we offer courses within the Computer Science bachelor programme in topics directly related to our research (Concurrent Programming, Programming Languages), as well as the general Introduction to Programming course.
At the graduate level, we offer a course package on <i>Digital Organizations: Models and Systems</i> within the Master programme in Computer Science.
This package consists of 4 courses (40 ECTS) and covers the theoretical and practical aspects of designing concurrent and distributed systems, specifying and validating their properties.
