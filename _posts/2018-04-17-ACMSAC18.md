Our group presented works on choreographic programming and microservices at the [33<sup>rd</sup> ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing](https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2018/).
[Marco Peressotti](/people#mp) gave a talk about choreographic communication abstractions in concurrent programming and [Janine Weber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-webs) presented a poster about patterns for failure handling in microservice programming (circuit breakers).
