On June 7th, [Fabrizio Montesi](/people.html#fm) and [Saverio Giallorenzo](/people.html#sg) took part in a meeting organised between the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://imada.sdu.dk) (IMADA) at SDU and [Orgbogen](https://www.ordbogen.com/), the largest web-based dictionary company in Denmark.

The meeting regarded future collaborations to research and apply bleeding-edge

settings. Ordbogen is also evaluating to run part of its future cloud infrastructure on the Danish National HPC Centre (Abacus 2.0 the supercomputer), hosted at the [eScience Center](escience.sdu.dk) at SDU.
