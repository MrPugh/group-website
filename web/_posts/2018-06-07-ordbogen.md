On June 7th, [Fabrizio Montesi](/people.html#fm) and [Saverio Giallorenzo](/people.html#sg) visited [Orgbogen](https://www.ordbogen.com/), the largest web-based dictionary company in Denmark, together with other researchers from the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://imada.sdu.dk) (IMADA) at SDU.

At the meeting, we discussed future collaborations on how the latest techniques in
Data Science, Cloud Computing, and the Danish National HPC Centre at the SDU [eScience Center](escience.sdu.dk) (the supercomputer Abacus 2.0) can be applied to Ordbogen's setting.
