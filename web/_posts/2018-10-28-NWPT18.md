On October 25<sup>th</sup>, [Marco Peressotti](/people.html#mp) gave a talk at the [30<sup>th</sup> Nordic Workshop on Programming Theory](https://nwpt2018.ifi.uio.no/) (NWPT'18) about "[Choreographies and Communication Failures](https://nwpt2018.ifi.uio.no/proceedings.pdf)".

In "[Choreographies and Communication Failures](https://nwpt2018.ifi.uio.no/proceedings.pdf)", [Fabrizio Montesi](/people.html#fm), and [Marco Peressotti](/people.html#mp) propose the first choreography model that allows for communication failures and the programming of user-defined code to deal with such failures. They validate their model by implementing common strategies for handling communication failures in a robust way, which in turn can be used as a library by choreographies that assume reliable communication.  They demonstrate the applicability of the model by defining a semantics-preserving compilation procedure towards a process calculus equipped with unreliable I/O actions.
