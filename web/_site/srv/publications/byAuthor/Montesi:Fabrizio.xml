		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is a paradigm for developing correct-by-construction concurrent programs, by writing high-level descriptions of the desired communications and then synthesising process implementations automatically. So far, choreographic programming has been explored in the &lt;i&gt;monadic&lt;/i&gt; setting: interaction terms express point-to-point communications of a single value. However, real-world systems often rely on interactions of &lt;i&gt;polyadic&lt;/i&gt; nature, where multiple values are communicated among two or more parties, like multicast, scatter-gather, and atomic exchanges.&lt;br /&gt;We introduce a new model for choreographic programming equipped with a primitive for grouped interactions that subsumes all the above scenarios. Intuitively, grouped interactions can be thought of as being carried out as one single interaction. In practice, they are implemented by processes that carry them out in a concurrent fashion. After formalising the intuitive semantics of grouped interactions, we prove that choreographic programs and their implementations are correct and deadlock-free by construction.</abstract>

		<abstract>We analyse different deployment setups for circuit breaker, a design pattern for preventing cascading failures by guarding calls towards a target service. Then, we define a unifying implementation strategy in the setting of microservices, by using the Jolie programming language. Our implementation captures all setups with a single program, by interpreting a circuit breaker as a decorator that is generic on the interface of its target service.</abstract>

		<abstract>In Choreographic Programming, a distributed system is programmed by giving a choreography, a global description of its interactions, instead of separately specifying the behaviour of each of its processes. Process implementations in terms of a distributed language can then be automatically projected from a choreography. We present Linear Compositional Choreographies (LCC), a proof theory for reasoning about programs that modularly combine choreographies with processes. Using LCC, we logically reconstruct a semantics and a projection procedure for programs. For the first time, we also obtain a procedure for extracting choreographies from process terms.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is a paradigm for distributed programming, where high-level &quot;Alice and Bob&quot; descriptions of communications (choreographies) are used to synthesise correct-by-construction programs. However, implementations of choreographic models use message routing technologies distant from their related theoretical models (e.g., CCS/π channels). This drives implementers to mediate discrepancies with the theory through undocumented, unproven adaptations, weakening the reliability of their implementations. As a solution, we propose the framework of Applied Choreographies (AC). In AC, programmers write choreographies in a language that follows the standard syntax and semantics of previous works. Then, choreographies are compiled to a real-world execution model for Service-Oriented Computing (SOC). To manage the complexity of this task, our compilation happens in three steps, respectively dealing with: implementing name-based communications using the concrete mechanism found in SOC, projecting a choreography to a set of processes, and translating processes to a distributed implementation in terms of services.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographies are global descriptions of interactions among concurrent components, most notably used in the settings of verification (e.g., Multiparty Session Types) and synthesis of correct-by-construction software (Choreographic Programming).  They require a top-down approach: programmers first write choreographies, and then use them to verify or synthesize their programs.  However, most existing software does not come with choreographies yet, which prevents their application.&lt;br /&gt;To attack this problem, we propose a novel methodology (called choreography extraction) that, given a set of programs or protocol specifications, automatically constructs a choreography that describes their behavior. The key to our extraction is identifying a set of paths in a graph that represents the symbolic execution of the programs of interest. Our method improves on previous work in several directions: we can now deal with programs that are equipped with a state and internal computation capabilities; time complexity is dramatically better; we capture programs that are correct but not necessarily synchronizable, i.e., they work because they exploit asynchronous communication.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is a paradigm for developing concurrent programs that are deadlock-free by construction, by programming communications declaratively and then synthesising process implementations automatically. Despite strong interest on choreographies, a foundational model that explains which computations can be performed with the hallmark constructs of choreographies is still missing.&lt;br /&gt;In this work, we introduce Core Choreographies (CC), a model that includes only the core primitives of choreographic programming. Every computable function can be implemented as a choreography in CC, from which we can synthesise a process implementation where independent computations run in parallel. We discuss the design of CC and argue that it constitutes a canonical model for choreographic programming.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is an emerging paradigm for correct-by-construction concurrent programming. However, its applicability is limited by the current lack of support for reusable procedures.&lt;br /&gt;We propose Procedural Choreographies (PC), a choreographic language model with full procedural abstraction. PC includes unbounded process creation and name mobility, yielding a powerful framework for writing correct concurrent algorithms that can be compiled into a process calculus. This increased expressivity requires a typing discipline to ensure that processes are properly connected when enacting procedures.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is a paradigm for the development of concurrent software, where deadlocks are prevented syntactically.  However, choreography languages are typically synchronous, whereas many real-world systems have asynchronous communications.  Previous attempts at enriching choreographies with asynchrony rely on &lt;i&gt;ad-hoc&lt;/i&gt; constructions, whose adequacy is only argued informally.  In this work, we formalise the properties that an asynchronous semantics for choreographies should have: messages can be sent without the intended receiver being ready, and all sent messages are eventually received.  We explore how out-of-order execution, used in choreographies for modelling concurrency, can be exploited to endow choreographies with an asynchronous semantics. Our approach satisfies the properties we identified.  We show how our development yields a pleasant correspondence with FIFO-based asynchronous messaging, modelled in a process calculus, and discuss how it can be adopted in more complex choreography models.</abstract>

		<abstract>We propose a Curry-Howard correspondence between a language for programming multiparty sessions and a generalisation of Classical Linear Logic (CLL). In this framework, propositions correspond to the local behaviour of a participant in a multiparty session type, proofs to processes, and proof normalisation to executing communications. Our key contribution is generalising duality, from CLL, to a new notion of n-ary compatibility, called coherence. Building on coherence as a principle of compositionality, we generalise the cut rule of CLL to a new rule for composing many processes communicating in a multiparty session. We prove the soundness of our model by showing the admissibility of our new rule, which entails deadlock-freedom via our correspondence.</abstract>

		<abstract>Microservices is an architectural style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Before presenting the current state of the art in the field, this chapter reviews the history of software architecture, the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and services first, and microservices later. Finally, open problems and future challenges are introduced. This survey primarily addresses newcomers to the discipline, while offering an academic viewpoint on the topic. In addition, we investigate some practical issues and point out a few potential solutions.</abstract>

		<abstract>Microservices is an emerging development paradigm where software is obtained by composing autonomous entities, called (micro)services. However, microservice systems are currently developed using general-purpose programming languages that do not provide dedicated abstractions for service composition. Instead, current practice is focused on the deployment aspects of microservices, in particular by using containerization. In this chapter, we make the case for a language-based approach to the engineering of microservice architectures, which we believe is complementary to current practice. We discuss the approach in general, and then we instantiate it in terms of the Jolie programming language.</abstract>

		<abstract>Classical Processes (CP) is a calculus where the proof theory of classical linear logic types processes `a la π-calculus, building on a CurryHoward correspondence between session types and linear propositions. We contribute to this research line by extending CP with process mobility, inspired by the Higher-Order π-calculus. The key to our calculus is that sequents are asymmetric: one side types sessions as in CP and the other types process variables, which can be instantiated with process values. The controlled interaction between the two sides ensures that process variables can be used at will, but always respecting the linear usage of sessions expected by the environment.</abstract>

		<abstract>We describe a first proposal for a new packaging system for microservices based on the Jolie programming language, called the Jolie Package Manager (JPM). Its main features revolve around service interfaces, which make the functionalities that a service provides and depends on explicit. For the first time, JPM supports binding a service to an externally-provided package, and a notion of interface parametricity that can be used to develop generic service libraries that can modify the behaviour of arbitrary services. We illustrate the latter with a generic circuit breaker package.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is a development methodology for concurrent software that guarantees correctness by construction. The key to this paradigm is to disallow mismatched I/O operations in programs, and mechanically synthesise process implementations.&lt;br /&gt;There is still a lack of practical illustrations of the applicability of choreographies to computational problems with standard concurrent solutions. In this work, we explore the potential of choreographic programming by writing concurrent algorithms for sorting, solving linear equations, and computing Fast Fourier Transforms. The lessons learned from this experiment give directions for future improvements of the paradigm.</abstract>

		<abstract>Microservices is an architectural style inspired by service-oriented computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Jolie is a programming language based on the microservices paradigm: the main building block of Jolie systems are services, in contrast to, e.g., functions or objects. The primitives offered by the Jolie language elicit many of the recurring patterns found in microservices, like load balancers and structured processes. However, Jolie still lacks some useful constructs for dealing with message types and data manipulation that are present in service-oriented computing. In this paper, we focus on the possibility of expressing choices at the level of data types, a feature well represented in standards for Web Services, e.g., WSDL. We extend Jolie to support such type choices and show the impact of our implementation on some of the typical scenarios found in microservice systems. This shows how computation can move from a process-driven to a data-driven approach, and leads to the preliminary identification of recurring communication patterns that can be shaped as design patterns.</abstract>

		<abstract>Wadler introduced Classical Processes (CP), a calculus based on a propositions-as-types correspondence between propositions of classical linear logic and session types. Carbone et al. introduced Multiparty Classical Processes, a calculus that generalises CP to multiparty session types, by replacing the duality of classical linear logic (relating two types) with a more general notion of coherence (relating an arbitrary number of types). This paper introduces variants of CP and MCP, plus a new intermediate calculus of Globally-governed Classical Processes (GCP). We show a tight relation between these three calculi, giving semantics-preserving translations from GCP to CP and from MCP to GCP. The translation from GCP to CP interprets a coherence proof as an arbiter process that mediates communications in a session, while MCP adds annotations that permit processes to communicate directly without centralised control.</abstract>

		<abstract>A recent trend in programming language research is to use behavioral type theory to ensure various correctness properties of largescale, communication-intensive systems. Behavioral types encompass concepts such as interfaces, communication protocols, contracts, and choreography. The successful application of behavioral types requires a solid understanding of several practical aspects, from their representation in a concrete programming language, to their integration with other programming constructs such as methods and functions, to design and monitoring methodologies that take behaviors into account. This survey provides an overview of the state of the art of these aspects, which we summarize as the pragmatics of behavioral types.</abstract>

		<abstract>We extend the Jolie programming language to capture the native modelling of process-aware web information systems, i.e., web information systems based upon the execution of business processes. Our main contribution is to offer a unifying approach for the programming of distributed architectures on the web, which can capture web servers, stateful process execution, and the composition of services via mediation. We discuss applications of this approach through a series of examples that cover, e.g., static content serving, multiparty sessions, and the evolution of web systems. Finally, we present a performance evaluation that includes a comparison of Jolie-based web systems to other frameworks and a measurement of its scalability.</abstract>

		<abstract>Microservices is an emerging paradigm for the development of distributed systems that, originating from Service-Oriented Architecture, focuses on the small dimension, the loose coupling, and the dynamic topology of services. Microservices are particularly appropriate for the development of distributed systems in the Cloud. However, their dynamic nature calls for suitable techniques for their automatic deployment. In this paper we address this problem and we propose JRO (Jolie Redeployment Optimiser), a tool for the automatic and optimised deployment of microservices written in the Jolie language. The tool uses Zephyrus, a state of the art tool that automatically generates a fully detailed Service-Oriented Architecture configuration starting from a partial and abstract description of the target application.</abstract>

		<abstract>We propose a Curry-Howard correspondence between a language for programming multiparty sessions and a generalisation of Classical Linear Logic (CLL). In this framework, propositions correspond to the local behaviour of a participant in a multiparty session type, proofs to processes, and proof normalisation to executing communications. Our key contribution is generalising duality, from CLL, to a new notion of n-ary compatibility, called coherence. Building on coherence as a principle of compositionality, we generalise the cut rule of CLL to a new rule for composing many processes communicating in a multiparty session. We prove the soundness of our model by showing the admissibility of our new rule, which entails deadlock-freedom via our correspondence.</abstract>

		<abstract>Jolie is an orchestration language conceived during Sensoria, an FP7 European project led by Martin Wirsing in the time frame 2005–2010. Jolie was designed having in mind both the novel –at project time– concepts related to Service-Oriented Computing and the traditional approach to the modelling of concurrency typical of process calculi. The foundational work done around Jolie during Sensoria has subsequently produced many concrete results. In this paper we focus on two distinct advancements, one aiming at the development of dynamically adaptable orchestrated systems and one focusing on global choreographic specifications. These works, more recently, contributed to the realisation of a framework for programming dynamically evolvable distributed ServiceOriented applications that are correct-by-construction</abstract>

		<abstract>In Choreographic Programming, a distributed system is programmed by giving a choreography, a global description of its interactions, instead of separately specifying the behaviour of each of its processes. Process implementations in terms of a distributed language can then be automatically projected from a choreography. We present Linear Compositional Choreographies (LCC), a proof theory for reasoning about programs that modularly combine choreographies with processes. Using LCC, we logically reconstruct a semantics and a projection procedure for programs. For the first time, we also obtain a procedure for extracting choreographies from process terms.</abstract>

		<abstract>A session-based process satisfies the progress property if its sessions never get stuck when it is executed in an adequate context. Previous work studied how to define progress by introducing the notion of catalysers, execution contexts generated from the type of a process. In this paper, we refine such definition to capture a more intuitive notion of context adequacy for checking progress. Interestingly, our new catalysers lead to a novel characterisation of progress in terms of the standard notion of lock-freedom. Guided by this discovery, we also develop a conservative extension of catalysers that does not depend on types, generalising the notion of progress to untyped session-based processes. We combine our results with existing techniques for lock-freedom, obtaining a new methodology for proving progress. Our methodology captures new processes wrt previous progress analysis based on session types.</abstract>

		<abstract>In Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), services are composed by coordinating their communications into a flow of interactions. Coloured Petri nets (CPN) offer a formal yet easy tool for modelling interactions in SOAs, however mapping abstract SOAs into executable ones requires a non-trivial and time-costly analysis. Here, we propose a methodology that maps CPN-modelled SOAs into Jolie SOAs (our target language), exploiting a collection of recurring control-flow patterns, called Workflow Patterns, as composable blocks of the translation. We validate our approach with a realistic use case. In addition, we pragmatically asses the expressiveness of Jolie wrt the considered WPs.</abstract>

		<abstract>We propose a new programming model that supports a compositionality of choreographies. The key of our approach is the introduction of partial choreographies, which can mix global descriptions with communications among external peers. We prove that if two choreographies are composable, then the endpoints independently generated from each choreography are also composable, preserving their typability and deadlock-freedom. The usability of our framework is demonstrated by modelling an industrial use case implemented in a tool for Web Services, Jolie.</abstract>

		<abstract>Over the last decade, global descriptions have been successfully employed for the verification and implementation of communicating systems, respectively as protocol specifications and choreographies. In this work, we bring these two practices together by proposing a purely-global programming model. We show a novel interpretation of asynchrony and parallelism in a global setting and develop a typing discipline that verifies choreographies against protocol specifications, based on multiparty sessions. Exploiting the nature of global descriptions, our type system defines a new class of deadlock-free concurrent systems (deadlock-freedom-bydesign), provides type inference, and supports session mobility. We give a notion of Endpoint Projection (EPP) which generates correct entity code (as π-calculus terms) from a choreography. Finally, we evaluate our approach by providing a prototype implementation for a concrete programming language and by applying it to some examples from multicore and service-oriented programming.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographies are global descriptions of system behaviors, from which the local behavior of each endpoint entity can be obtained automatically through projection. To guarantee that its projection is correct, i.e. it has the same behaviors of the original choreography, a choreography usually has to respect some coherency conditions. This restricts the set of choreographies that can be projected. In this paper, we present a transformation for amending choreographies that do not respect common syntactic conditions for projection correctness. Specifically, our transformation automatically reduces the amount of concurrency, and it infers and adds hidden communications that make the resulting choreography respect the desired conditions, while preserving its behavior.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographies are descriptions of distributed systems where the developer gives a global view of how messages are exchanged by endpoint nodes (endpoints for short), instead of separately defining the behaviour of each endpoint. They have a significant impact on the quality of software, as they offer a concise view of the message flows enacted by a system. For this reason, in the last decade choreographies have been employed in the development of programming languages, giving rise to a programming paradigm that in this dissertation we refer to as Choreographic Programming. Recent formal investigations of choreographies show that they have potential as foundations for the development of safe distributed software. The key idea is that since choreographies abstract from the single input/output actions of endpoints, they avoid typical safety problems such as deadlocks and race conditions; the concrete implementation of each endpoint described in a choreography can then be automatically obtained by compilation, ensuring that such implementations are also safe by construction from the originating choreography. However, current formal models for choreographies do not deal with critical aspects of distributed programming, such as asynchrony, mobility, modularity, and multiparty sessions; it remains thus unclear whether choreographies can still guarantee safety when dealing with such nontrivial features. This PhD dissertation argues for the usefulness of choreographic programming as a paradigm for the development of safe distributed systems. We proceed by investigating its foundations and application. To this aim we provide three main contributions. The first contribution is the development of a formal model and type theory for choreographic programming that support asynchrony, mobility, modular development, and multiparty sessions. We prove that our model guarantees safety by mapping choreographies to distributed implementations in terms of a variant of the π-calculus, the reference model for mobile processes. Our translation preserves the expected safety properties of choreographies, among which freedom from deadlocks and race conditions. The second contribution is the development of Linear Connection Logic (LCL), a formal logic that captures the reasoning behind choreographic programming. We show that LCL is a conservative extension of Linear Logic. We then develop a Curry-Howard correspondence between LCL and a calculus of choreographies, proving that: (i) proofs in LCL correspond to choreographies; and (ii) the transformations between proofs in LCL to proofs in Linear Logic and vice versa correspond to compiling choreography programs to π-calculus terms and vice versa. The latter result, known as round-trip development, contributes to the open problem of extracting choreographies from existing endpoint programs. The third contribution is the implementation of a prototype programming framework for choreographic programming, called Chor. Chor provides an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming with choreographies, equipped with a type checker for verifying that choreographies respect protocol specifications given as session types. Programs in Chor can be compiled to executable endpoint implementation in the Jolie programming language, a general-purpose language for distributed computing, which we extend to support the development of multiparty asynchronous sessions. We use Chor for evaluating choreographic programming against a series of use cases.</abstract>

		<abstract>In the context of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs), the integration of services is an important aspect that is usually addressed by using specific tools, such as Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). In this paper we propose a framework to perform service integration building on the extension of service interfaces, capturing a class of service integrators that are decoupled from the services they integrate in an SOA. We show how our service integrators can be used in practice by evaluating our approach with Jolie, a serviceoriented programming language. Finally, we present how our methodology differs from the standard practice with ESB.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreography-based programming is a powerful paradigm for defining communication-based systems from a global viewpoint. A choreography can be checked against multiparty protocol specifications, given as behavioural types, that may be instantiated indefinitely at runtime. Each protocol instance is started with a synchronisation among the involved peers. We analyse a simple transformation from a choreography with a possibly unbounded number of protocol instantiations to a choreography instantiating a single protocol, which is the merge of the original ones. This gives an effective methodology for obtaining new protocols by composing existing ones. Moreover, by removing all synchronisations required for starting protocol instances, our transformation reduces the number of communications and resources needed to execute a choreography.</abstract>

		<abstract>A fundamental aspect which affects the efficiency and the performance of Service-Oriented Architectures is the mechanism which allows to manage sessions and, in particular, to assign incoming messages to the correct sessions (also known as service instances). A relevant mechanism for solving this problem, first introduced by BPEL and then used in other languages (e.g. Jolie) is that one based on correlation sets. The BPEL and Jolie languages are currently allowing the use of messages whose target is only one session. However there are a lot of scenarios where being able to send a broadcast message to more than one session could be useful. Supporting such a broadcast primitive means to allow correlation sets which can contain unspecified variables and this can be very inefficient, since usual implementations in terms of hash tables cannot be used in this case. In this paper we propose a data structure, based on radix trees and an algorithm for managing a correlation mechanism that supports the broadcast primitive, without degrading the performances.</abstract>

		<abstract>Correlation sets define a powerful mechanism for routing incoming communications to the correct running session within a server, by inspecting the content of the received messages. We present a language for programming services based on correlation sets taking into account key aspects of service-oriented systems, such as distribution, loose coupling, open-endedness and integration. Distinguishing features of our approach are the notion of correlation aliases and an asynchronous communication model. Our language is equipped with formal syntax, semantics, and a typing system for ensuring desirable properties of programs with respect to correlation sets. We provide an implementation as an extension of the JOLIE language and apply it to a nontrivial real-world example of a fully-functional distributed user authentication system.</abstract>

		<abstract>We describe the different issues that a language designer has to tackle when defining error handling mechanisms for service-oriented computing. We first discuss the issues that have to be considered when developing error handling mechanisms inside a process calculus, i.e. an abstract model. We then analyze how these issues change when moving from a process calculus to a full-fledged language based on it. We consider as an example the language Jolie, and the calculus SOCK it is based upon.</abstract>

		<abstract>We propose a new approach to dynamic adaptation, based on the combination of adaptation hooks provided by the adaptable application specifying where adaptation can happen, and adaptation rules external to the application, specifying when and how adaptation can be performed. We discuss different design choices that have to be considered when using such an approach, and then we propose a possible solution. We describe the solution in details, we apply it to a sample scenario and we implement it on top of the language Jolie.</abstract>

		<abstract>We present a model of components following the process calculus approach. The main problem was isolating primitives that capture the relevant concepts of component-based systems. The key features of the calculus are: a hierarchical structure of components; a prominent role to input/output interfaces; the possibility of stopping and capturing components; a mechanism of channel interactions, orthogonal to the activity of components, which may produce tunneling effects that bypass the component hierarchy. We present the calculus, explain the syntax, formulate its operational semantics and a basic type system. We show a number of examples of use of the calculus, with particular emphasis to common evolvability patterns for components.</abstract>

		<abstract>Service Oriented Computing (SOC) allows for the composition of services which communicate using unidirectional one-way or bidirectional request-response communication patterns. Most service orchestration languages proposed so far provide also primitives for error handling based on fault, termination, and compensation handlers. Our work is motivated by the difficulties encountered in programming some error handling strategies using current error handling primitives. We propose as a solution an orchestration programming style in which handlers are dynamically installed. We assess our proposal by formalizing our approach as an extension of the process calculus SOCK and by proving that our formalization satisfies some expected high-level properties.</abstract>

		<abstract>Service Oriented Computing (SOC) allows for the composition of services which communicate using unidirectional notification or bidirectional request-response primitives. Most service orchestration languages proposed so far provide also primitives to handle faults and compensations. The interplay between fault handling and request-response invocations is nontrivial since, for instance, faults should be notified to the requestresponse communication partners in order to compensate also the remote activities. Our work is motivated by the difficulties encountered in programming, using current orchestration languages, some fault handling strategies. We propose as a solution an orchestration programming style in which fault and compensation handlers are dynamically installed. We show the adequacy of our proposal defining its semantics, and proving that it satisfies some expected high-level properties. Finally, we also show how to apply dynamic handler installation in a nontrivial automotive scenario.</abstract>

		<abstract>Dynamic fault handling is a new approach for dealing with fault management in service-oriented applications. Fault handlers, termination handlers and compensation handlers are installed at execution time instead of being statically defined. In this paper we present this programming style and our implementation of dynamic fault handling in JOLIE, providing finally a nontrivial example of its usage.</abstract>

		<abstract>In service oriented computing, choreography languages are used to specify multi-party service compositions. Two main approaches have been followed: the interaction-oriented approach of WS-CDL and the process-oriented approach of BPEL4Chor. We investigate the relationship between them.In particular, we consider several interpretations for interaction-oriented choreographies spanning from synchronous to asynchronous communication. Under each of these interpretations we characterize the class of interaction-oriented choreographies which have a process-oriented counterpart, and we formalize the notion of equivalence between the initial interaction-oriented choreography and the corresponding process-oriented one.</abstract>

		<abstract>Service composition and service statefulness are key concepts in Web Service system programming. In this paper we present JOLIE, which is the full implementation of our formal calculus for service orchestration called SOCK. JOLIE inherits all the formal semantics of SOCK and provides a C-like syntax which allows the programmer to design the service behaviour and the service deployment information separately. The service behaviour is exploited to design the interaction workflow and the computational functionalities of the service, whereas the service deployment information deals with service interface definition, statefulness and service session management. On the one hand, JOLIE offers a simple syntax for dealing with service composition and efficient multiple request processing; on the other hand, it is based on a formal semantics which offers a solid development base, along with the future possibility of creating automated tools for testing system properties such as deadlock freeness.</abstract>

		<abstract>Service oriented computing is an emerging paradigm for programming distributed applications based on services. Services are simple software elements that supply their functionalities by exhibiting their interfaces and that can be invoked by exploiting simple communication primitives. The emerging mechanism exploited in service oriented computing for composing services –in order to provide more complex functionalities by means of orchestrators. An orchestrator is able to invoke and coordinate other services by exploiting typical workflow patterns such as parallel composition, sequencing and choices. Examples of orchestration languages are XLANG and WS-BPEL. In this paper we present JOLIE, an interpreter and engine for orchestration programs. The main novelties of JOLIE are that it provides an easy to use development environment (because it supports a more programmer friendly C/Java-like syntax instead of an XML-based syntax) and it is based on a solid mathematical underlying model (developed in previous works of the authors).</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is a paradigm for developing concurrent programs that are deadlock-free by construction, by syntactically disallowing mismatched I/O and then synthesising process implementations automatically. Most choreography models assume that all communication occurs synchronously between two parties. This has been relaxed in some settings, allowing for example asynchronous communications, many-to-one, or one-to-many. However, these extensions are hardcoded in the syntax and semantics of each particular model.&lt;br /&gt;In this work, we present Cho-Reo-graphies (CR), a model where choreographies are parametric in the (Reo) connectors through which parties communicate. CR is the first choreography model where different communication semantics (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous) can freely be mixed in the same choreography. We prove that if a choreography respects the rules of the connectors that it uses, then the process implementation that we can synthesise from it enjoys deadlock freedom.</abstract>

		<abstract>We present Multiparty Classical Choreographies (MCC), a language model where global descriptions of communicating systems (choreographies) and processes can be modularly composed to implement typed multiparty sessions. Typing is achieved by generalising classical linear logic to judgements that explicitly record parallelism by means of hypersequents. Our approach unifies different lines of work on choreographies and processes with multiparty sessions, as well as their connection to linear logic. Thus, results developed in one context are carried over to the others. Key novelties of MCC include support for behavioural polymorphism in choreographies, as well as a translation from processes with replication to choreographies.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is a paradigm for developing concurrent programs that are deadlock-free by construction, by programming communications declaratively and then synthesising process implementations automatically. Despite strong interest on choreographies, a foundational model that explains which computations can be performed with the hallmark constructs of choreographies is still missing.&lt;br /&gt;In this work, we introduce Core Choreographies (CC), a model that includes only the core primitives of choreographic programming. Every computable function can be implemented as a choreography in CC, from which we can synthesise a process implementation where independent computations run in parallel. We discuss the design of CC and argue that it constitutes a canonical model for choreographic programming.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is an emerging paradigm for correct-by-construction concurrent programming based on message passing. Models based on choreographic programming have been successfully developed for different settings where concurrent programming is challenging, including service-oriented computing and cyber-physical systems. However, the general applicability of the paradigm is limited by the current lack of support for reusable procedures, which hinders modularity.&lt;br /&gt;We propose Procedural Choreographies (PC), a choreographic language model with full procedural abstraction. PC includes unbounded process creation and name mobility, yielding a powerful framework for writing correct concurrent algorithms that can be compiled into a process calculus. This expressivity requires a typing discipline to ensure that processes are properly connected when enacting procedures. Connections may form networks of arbitrary graph structures. We develop a formal synthesis procedure that, given a program in PC, generates a correct-by-construction concurrent implementation in terms of a process calculus. We illustrate the expressivity of PC with a series of examples, including parallel streams and parallel computation based on pipelining.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is a paradigm for the development of concurrent software, where deadlocks are prevented syntactically and then correct-by-construction implementations in process models are mechanically generated. The formal semantics of choreography languages are typically based on synchronous communications, in order to achieve a simpler theory. However, many real-world systems have asynchronous communications. Previous attempts at enriching choreographies with asynchrony rely on &lt;i&gt;ad-hoc&lt;/i&gt; constructions, whose adequacy is only argued informally.&lt;br /&gt;In this work, we present a systematic study of asynchronous communications in choreographies. First, we discuss and formalise the properties that an asynchronous semantics for choreographies should have. Then, we explore how out-of-order execution, previously used in choreographies for modelling concurrency, can be used to endow choreographies with an asynchronous semantics that satisfies our properties. Our development yields a pleasant correspondence with FIFO-based asynchronous messaging, modelled in a process calculus. Finally, we investigate the expressivity of choreography languages with respect to asynchrony. Specifically, we find out that choreography languages equipped with process spawning and name mobility primitives are expressive enough to program asynchronous behaviour over a simple synchronous semantics.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographic Programming is a methodology for the development of concurrent software based on a correctness-by-construction approach which, given a global description of a system (a choreography), automatically generates deadlock-free communicating programs via an EndPoint Projection (EPP). Previous works use target-languages for EPP that, like their source choreography languages, model communications using channel names (e.g., variants of CCS and π-calculus). This leaves a gap between such models and real-world implementations, where communications are concretely supported by low-level mechanisms for message routing. We bridge this gap by developing Applied Choreographies (AC), a new model for choreographic programming. AC brings the correctness-by-construction methodology of choreographies down to the level of a real executable language. The key feature of AC is that its semantics is based on message correlation --- a standard technique in Service-Oriented Computing --- while retaining the usual simple and intuitive syntax of choreography languages. We provide AC with a typing discipline that ensures the correct use of the low-level mechanism of message correlation, thus avoiding communication errors. We also define a two-step compilation from AC to a low-level Correlation Calculus, which is the basis of a real executable language (Jolie). Finally, we prove an operational correspondence theorem, which ensures that compiled programs behave as the original choreography. This is the first result of such correctness property in the case of a real-world implemented language.</abstract>

		<abstract>Choreographies are global descriptions of communication structures, inspired by the &quot;Alice and Bob&quot; notation of security protocols. They have been successfully employed in the design and implementation of distributed systems. However, there is still limited evidence of the applicability of choreographies in the real-world setting of distributed programming, where communication actions may fail. In this work, we propose the first choreography model that allows for communication failures and the programming of user-defined code to deal with such failures. We validate our model by implementing common strategies for handling communication failures in a robust way, which in turn can be used as a library by choreographies that assume reliable communication. We equip our model with a typing discipline that can statically verify reliability properties, in particular at-most-once and exactly-once delivery. We demonstrate the applicability of our model by defining a semantics-preserving compilation procedure towards a process calculus equipped with unreliable I/O actions.</abstract>

		<abstract>We introduce the calculus of Classical Transitions (CT), which extends the research line on the relationship between linear logic and processes to labelled transitions. The key twist from previous work is registering parallelism in typing judgements, by generalising linear logic judgements from one sequents to many (hypersequents). This allows us to bridge the gap between the structures of operators used as proof terms in previous work and those of the standard π-calculus (in particular parallel operator and restriction). The proof theory of CT allows for new proof transformations, which we show correspond to a labelled transition system (LTS) for processes. We prove that CT enjoys subject reduction and progress.</abstract>
